## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

**Objective**: Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a virtual network.

- **Tools Used**: Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit
- **Description**: Conducted a full vulnerability assessment on a virtual network using Nmap for network scanning, Nessus for vulnerability detection, and Metasploit for exploitation.
- **Key Skills**: Vulnerability scanning, ethical hacking, network security.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Set up a vulnerable VM like **Metasploitable**.
    2. Run Nmap scans to identify open ports and services.
    3. Use Nessus to scan for known vulnerabilities.
    4. Exploit vulnerabilities using Metasploit.

## Web Application Security Testing

**Objective**: Test a web application for security flaws.

- **Tools Used**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- **Description**: Performed penetration testing on a vulnerable web application (e.g., **DVWA** or **OWASP Juice Shop**) to find and mitigate SQL injection, XSS, and other web vulnerabilities.
- **Key Skills**: Web security, OWASP Top 10, input validation.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Set up a vulnerable web app (e.g., **DVWA**).
    2. Use Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to test for web vulnerabilities.
    3. Attempt to exploit found vulnerabilities and suggest fixes.

## Firewall Configuration with iptables

**Objective**: Secure a Linux server by configuring firewall rules using iptables.

- **Tools Used**: iptables
- **Description**: Set up a firewall using iptables to control incoming and outgoing traffic, limiting access to specific services.
- **Key Skills**: Network security, Linux security.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Set up a Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS).
    2. Install iptables and configure rules to block/allow specific ports and IPs.
    3. Test the firewall configuration using tools like Nmap.

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Setup

**Objective**: Build and configure an Intrusion Detection System to monitor network traffic.

- **Tools Used**: Snort, Suricata
- **Description**: Configured an IDS to detect network threats by monitoring traffic patterns and identifying potential intrusions.
- **Key Skills**: Network monitoring, intrusion detection.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Set up Snort or Suricata on a Linux system.
    2. Configure IDS rules to detect suspicious traffic.
    3. Simulate attacks (e.g., port scans, DDoS) and monitor IDS alerts.

## Password Cracking & Brute-Force Simulation

**Objective**: Demonstrate password cracking techniques using brute-force and dictionary attacks.

- **Tools Used**: John the Ripper, Hashcat
- **Description**: Simulated cracking of hashed passwords using brute-force and dictionary attacks to demonstrate weaknesses in password security.
- **Key Skills**: Cryptography, password security.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Use a list of hashed passwords (e.g., MD5 or SHA-256).
    2. Use John the Ripper or Hashcat to attempt password cracking.
    3. Compare cracking times for weak vs. strong passwords.

## Wi-Fi Network Security

**Objective**: Secure a Wi-Fi network and analyze its traffic.

- **Tools Used**: Wireshark, Aircrack-ng
- **Description**: Set up a WPA2/WPA3 wireless network, analyze network traffic, and simulate attacks using tools like Aircrack-ng.
- **Key Skills**: Wireless security, network encryption.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Set up a virtual or real wireless network.
    2. Use Wireshark to monitor network traffic.
    3. Attempt to crack WPA2 encryption with Aircrack-ng and compare to WPA3.

## Encryption & Decryption with Python

**Objective**: Implement file encryption and decryption using Python.

- **Tools Used**: Python (PyCryptodome library)
- **Description**: Wrote a Python script to encrypt and decrypt files using algorithms like AES or RSA.
- **Key Skills**: Cryptography, secure file handling.
- **How to Run**:
    1. Install the PyCryptodome library (`pip install pycryptodome`).
    2. Run the encryption script to secure a file.
    3. Use the decryption script to restore the file.
